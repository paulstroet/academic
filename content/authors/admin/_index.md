My name is Paul Stroet and I am a PhD candidate under supervision of prof. dr. [Arjen van Witteloostuijn](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/a-van-witteloostuijn) and prof. dr. [Svetlana Khapova](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/sn-khapova) at the VU School of Business and Economics. I obtained my MPhil in [Business Data Science](https://businessdatascience.nl/graduate-program) (2021), my MSc in [Data Science and Marketing Analytics](https://www.eur.nl/en/master/data-science-and-marketing-analytics/study-programme) (2021), and my BSc in [Economics](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/bachelors/economics--business-economics/meet-the-people/paul-stroet.html?cb) (2019). My research interests evolve around deep learning, and lie specifically at the intersection of methodological development and application of models in deep generative modeling, variational Bayesian inference and outlier detection. I am very fascinated by uncovering the potential of deep learning in information systems as well.
