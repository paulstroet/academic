My name is Paul Stroet and I am a research master student at [Business Data Science](https://businessdatascience.nl/graduate-program). This fall I will join the [Management and Organisation](https://sbe.vu.nl/en/departments-and-institutes/management-and-organisation/index.aspx) department at the VU School of Business and Economics as a PhD student under the supervision of prof. [Svetlana Khapova](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/sn-khapova) and prof. [Arjen van Witteloostuijn](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/a-van-witteloostuijn). My research interests evolve around deep learning, and lie specifically at the intersection of methodological development and application of models in deep generative modeling, variational Bayesian inference and outlier detection. I am very fascinated by uncovering the potential of deep learning in information systems as well. In my thesis for Business Data Science I deploy advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract features from text data and consequently use these features in predictive modeling. My supervisor is prof. [Marc van de Wardt](http://www.marcvandewardt.com/) (Business Data Science). In my thesis for Data Science & Marketing Analytics I focus on enhancing the detection of outliers and I am supervised by [prof. Philip Hans Franses](https://www.eur.nl/en/people/philip-hans-franses) (Econometrics Institute) and [prof. Eran Raviv](https://eranraviv.com/about/) (Business Data Science).
