My name is Paul Stroet and I am a research master student at [Business Data Science](https://businessdatascience.nl/graduate-program). My research interests evolve around marketing, and lie specifically at the intersection of methodological development and application of marketing models. I am very fascinated by uncovering the potential of deep learning in marketing models as well. My thesis focuses on enhancing the detection of outliers and I am supervised by [prof. Philip Hans Franses](https://www.eur.nl/en/people/philip-hans-franses) (Econometrics Institute) and [dr. Eran Raviv](https://eranraviv.com/about/) (Business Data Science).
