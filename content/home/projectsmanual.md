Currently, I am working on two interesting projects. One project is focusing on the role of consumer sentiment for merger and acquisitions (M&A). The projects aims at connecting twitter sentiment to firm value gathered from other data sources, such as Compustat. First, we plan to categorize the content generated by firms involved in M&A to assess the fit between two firms (in terms of brand personality). Second, we plan to create a social media capability score as a ratio between the social media content generated by the firm divided by the Klout score and test if it can be used as a proxy for marketing capabilities, or if it explains additional variation in term of firm performance beyond what is attributed by marketing capabilities. In the second project I aim to construct an early warning system for ‘breakthrough’ innovations in the course [Data Driven Innovation Strategies](https://businessdatascience.nl/courses/171/data-driven-innovation-strategy).
