Currently, I am working on three interesting projects. The first one is a continuation of my thesis at Business Data Science, in which I created text-based measurements of personality scores from web-scraped parliamentary speeches. These features are used in a modeling approach to not only predict the personality traits, but also to assess how well they perform by comparing the predictions to survey-based measures of personality. The results indeed show that machine encoded features outperform conventional human encoded features (e.g. LIWC, MRC) in predicting personality scores, and that text-based measures of personality traits can serve as an appropriate proxy for personality traits. The second project aims to find a novel method in alleviating stress. The data is collected by means of daily measurements of perceptions of stress, and these are consequently combined with physical indicators collected through wearable devices. The third project aims to efficiently (1) summarize and (2) synthesize large corpora of text. These automated literature reviews will initially be developed in the context of scientific literature in a specific subfield of Management Science: Careers.
