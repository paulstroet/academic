Currently I am working on two interesting projects, one concerning Monte Carlo simulation in the course [Bayesian Econometrics](https://businessdatascience.nl/courses/200/bayesian-econometrics), and the other one in constructing an early warning system for ‘breakthrough’ innovations in the course [Data Driven Innovation Strategies](https://businessdatascience.nl/courses/171/data-driven-innovation-strategy).
